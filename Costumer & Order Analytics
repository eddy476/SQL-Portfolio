##In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1.How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2.How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product= 'iPhone';

#3.Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID;

#4.Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6.Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?


SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity>2;

#8.List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
ORDER BY Product
